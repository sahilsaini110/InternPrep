## OOPS
### constructor
- lets take a real worl ex,
- let say a boss need to assign a task to employ in two ways:-

  - boss---->secy---->employee <!--here this will take time as well as there is chnace of loss of data --> 
  - boss------------->employee <!-- this is how contructor work it is call as soon as we create a object and do all the nessasary task need to be done as soon as object is created.-->

- they have same name as that of class and do not have any return type.

### operator overloading 
##### if we want + to add two objects.
  - traditional way by writing a function 
  - by operator overloading.
  
  
  
  ` 
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;

    int main(){

    return 0;
    }
